      "Architected an end-to-end GenAI pipeline using chained SoTA open-source models (Wan 2.1, Sam2, GroundingDino, NormalCrafter, ...) with quantization, depth/pose encoding, & frame stitching to launch SoTA video head-swap (unlike face-swap, not commercially produced by any competitors); tool serves 5M+ MAU",
      "Enabled 48% GPU cost reductions by LoRA-fine-tuning and quantizing models, converting them to TensorRT engines (improving inference scalability), then batching inference on A100s via Triton CUDA graphs"
